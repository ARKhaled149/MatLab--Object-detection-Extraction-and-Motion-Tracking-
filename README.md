# MatLab--Object-detection-Extraction-and-Motion-Tracking-
Implementing moving object detection and then applying a motion tracking algorithm. Then, outputing a video for each tracked object, the final output have multiple videos with each video having only one object and the rest of the image is black.

### Steps:
### 1.   Read the video and extract the different video frames into images.
### 2.   Convert the video frames from RGB to Grayscale.
### 3.   Find and use any predefined algorithm capable of detecting and classifying people within images.
### 4.   Use the algorithm to draw bounding boxes around the objects
### 5.   Track the objects within the scene
### 6.   Extract each tracked object within a separate video. (an example is attached below)
### 7.   The output should be a number of videos according to the tracked objects (ex: 2 tracked objects = 2 output videos)
### 8.   The output videos must be RGB
